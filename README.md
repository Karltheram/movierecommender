Final project DSA: TheNextWatch
This is our final project three for our data structures and algorithms class. 
We created a movie recommender with 700000 data points using Heapsort and Maps. We wrote the two data structures from scratch.

Be sure to type the movie name correctly or it will ask for you to type it again. 
Follow the instructions in the terminal to go through the reccomender.
